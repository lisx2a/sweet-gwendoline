	<p style="line-height:1.3em;color:#8ba1b1;font-size:1.1em;margin-bottom:10px;font-family:Trebuchet MS">Inspired by renowned, pioneering bondage artist John Willie, and made infamous by the classic magazine Bizarre, Sweet Gwendoline is back to service you. Believing that all women should embrace their mischievous side, our fashions push the boundaries of flirtatious seduction. A little naughty. <br />Never too nice. Always divinely sexy.</p>
	<p style="line-height:1.3em;color:#8ba1b1;font-size:1.1em;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">Our adventure begins with simple but provocative tops, combining 40's era elegance with a modern design approach. But it's just the beginning. Look for Sweet Gwendoline to continue exploring erotic scenerios, with figure trimming intimates, exotic footwear and suggestive home décor. Indulge yourself, and delight in the thrill.</p>

		<h3>Dirty Larry</h3>
 		A fixture on the Philadelphia and New York art scene, Larry McGearty sees his work as the gritty, streetwise answer to Martha Stewart. "I'd say I'm like her evil
		win, the Anti-Martha."<br />
		From his start as creator of the rockabilly clothing line, Retroactive in 1989, to developing Sailor Jerry, the tattoo lifestyle venture that includes clothing, 
		housewares and a spiced rum, Larry has relied on his fearless instinct for embracing the cutting edge. Blending old world style and vintage refinery with 
		modern cues and a playful kinkiness he takes a holistic approach to design.<br />
		This same "take a bite out of life" philosophy has led Larry to release Sweet Gwendoline, a woman's line of basics and intimates that Larry describes as a little
		naughty and never too nice.<br />
		"I create lifestyle brands, where every detail matters...only my worldview is darker and basically twisted and fun. I'm a modern day smut merchant."</p>

		<h3>JJ</h3>
	Intrigued by the artistic aspects of BDSM his entire life, JJ has acquired vast insight into the culture and what makes it purr. Always dabbling with fashion in one way or another, JJ never stopped being drawn to fetish style as inspiration.<br />
	HeroineHeels, an online fetish shoe store, was JJ's first venture into the lifestyle, allowing him to gain invaluable knowledge about hot fetish style, as well as learning how to satisfy this finicky consumer.<br />
	Starting Sweet Gwendoline with Larry McGearty was an obvious next step, taking advantage of the creative chemistry between them, and perfectly applying all the passion and experience JJ has for the genre.</p>
